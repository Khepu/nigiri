# Merging cron expressions

Have you ever wondered when 2 crons can be merged? Take some time to think about
it for yourself, it's a fun problem.

Let's start by defining what merge means here. The cron expression that is
produced by this operation would need to have all the trigger times of the
first, plus all the trigger times of the second, without introducing any new
ones.

Simple right? It actually is. So long as the expressions differ in only 1
segment then they are pretty easy to merge:

```
'0 1 * * *'  + '0 2-4 * * *' = '0 1-4 * * *'
'0 1 JAN * *'  + '0 1 JUL * *' = '0 1 * JAN,JUL *'
```
