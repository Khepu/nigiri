Have you ever wondered when 2 crons can be merged? Take some time to think about it for yourself, it's a fun problem.

Let's start by defining what merge means here. The cron expression that is produced by this operation would need to have all the trigger times of the first, plus all the trigger times of the second, without introducing any new ones.

Simple, right? It actually is. So long as the expressions differ in only one segment then they are pretty easy to merge:
```
'0 1 * * *' + '0 2-4 * * *' = '0 1-4 * * *'
'0 1 JAN * *' + '0 1 JUL * *' = '0 1 * JAN,JUL *'
```

If they differ in more than one segments then merging them would introduce new trigger times, which is unwanted.

## Merging multiple cron expressions

Here is where it gets tricky. Consider the following 3 expressions:
1. `0 1 * * *`
2. `30 1 * * *`
3. `0 2 * * *`

Both 2 and 3 can be merged with 1 but, after doing so, the resulting cron would not be compatible with what is left. The order in which crons are merged matters! Thinking about crons as a list though does not help me, let's switch to using graphs for this. The expressions will be nodes and the edges will connect expressions that can be merged. Edges are bidirectional and include the segment over which the merge is possible.

Seeing the problem visualized, the first question that pops up in my head is: How many edges can there be between 2 nodes? It turns out there are only 3 options here. 0 if they cannot be merged, 1 if they can, and 5 if they are exactly the same. We can limit this to just the first 2 cases by considering only a unique set of crons, eliminating any duplicates.

The graph is great because it poses another very direct question: Which way do you merge? For this example it does not matter, you are going to end up with 2 expressions that cannot be further simplified, but let's look at a larger example to put things into perspective.
