One of the more common uses of SIMD in this project is using it for character comparisons. Instead of comparing characters one by one, you load their numerical value into an unsigned-byte array of length 32 (`32 * 8 bits = 256 bits` which is the size of the AVX SIMD pack ) and then compare it (`sb-simd-avx2:u8.32=`) with the numeric value of another character. What you get back from this comparison is another SIMD pack where values are either `0`, for false, or `255`, for true.

```clojure
(sb-simd-avx2:u8.32= my-chunk
                     (sb-simd-avx2:u8.32 (char-code #\")))
```

Obviously looping over that vector largely defeats the purpose of SIMD. Thankfully, there is a better way, though slightly more convoluted... You can take the result of the previous comparison and turn it into a bitmap using `sb-simd-avx2:u8.32-movemask`. `movemask` is a tricky one, it took me a while to understand why the result is exactly what it's supposed to be. Let's look at an example:

```clojure
(defun why-is-my-bitmap-like-that ()
  (let ((chunk (make-array (list +chunk-length+)
                           :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)
                           :initial-element 0))
        (pack-of-1s (sb-simd-avx2:u8.32 1)))
    (setf (aref chunk 1) 1)
    (let* ((chunk (sb-simd-avx2:u8.32-aref chunk 0)) ;; convert the array to a SIMD pack
           (pack-one-p (sb-simd-avx2:u8.32= chunk pack-of-1s))
           (bitmap (sb-simd-avx2:u8.32-movemask pack-one-p)))
      (format nil "~b" bitmap))))

(why-is-my-bitmap-like-that)
=> "10"
```

I would expect my result to be: `"0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000"`. Well, it's "backwards". Not really, because the first item of the array has been moved into the first bit of the bitmap and all leading zeroes have been ommitted. Makes a lot of sense when you think about it like that...

How does this help us? The 1s in the bitmap represent all the characters in the initial string that are of interest, and we can skip over anything that's a 0. To do that, my initial idea was a bithack:

```clojure
(defun rightmost-bit (n)
  (declare (type fixnum n))
  (the fixnum
    (logand (1+ (lognot n)) n)))

(defun rightmost-bit-index (n)
  "Returns a 0-based index of the location of the rightmost set bit of `n'."
  (the fixnum (truncate (log (rightmost-bit n) 2))))

(defun unset-rightmost-bit (n)
  (declare (type fixnum n))
  (logxor n (rightmost-bit n)))
```

You take a number `n`, flip the bits, add 1, use bitwise-and with the original number and you end up isolating the rightmost set bit. Almost there, here comes the ugly part. We need to convert that number into the index of the set bit in order to use it as an offset and locate the original character in the string we are parsin. There are really 2 ways to do this (that I know of):
1. use the `log` function with base 2 (what you see above)
2. basically brute force it by shifting a bit from index 0 to the left until it equals the original number.

Looking for something built into SBCL did not lead anywhere either. I hate both, for different reasons. It was good enough for a while but at some point `rightmost-bit-index` popped up in my profiler:

Throughout my journey with SIMD my biggest resource was people playing with similar things in C/C++. Most of the time I could look into what they are doing and roughly translate that to CL. That's how I learned the basics of SIMD, documentation for it in SBCL is scarce to say the least.

This time I was less enthusiastic to see their solution. Modern CPUs have a specific set of [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_Bit_manipulation_instruction_set) to do these kinds of operations. If they are cheating then so am I.

## Defining new intrinsics

If SIMD in SBCL feels like a dark room with no light switch, then defining your own virtual operators feels like you are in a dark forest. It's one of those things that you have to learn by reading through the existing examples, and there are many in SBCL's repo but I still felt lost. This is the only real [resource](https://pvk.ca/Blog/2014/08/16/how-to-define-new-intrinsics-in-sbcl/) that explains some of the things you see used in virtual operators and that's what I blindly followed:

```clojure
(in-package :sb-vm)
(import '(sb-assem:inst))

(defknown bit-scan-forward ((unsigned-byte 64)) (integer 0 64)
    (foldable flushable movable))

(define-vop (bit-scan-forward)
  (:policy :fast-safe)
  (:translate bit-scan-forward)
  (:args (x :scs (unsigned-reg) :target r))
  (:arg-types unsigned-num)
  (:results (r :scs (unsigned-reg)))
  (:result-types unsigned-num)
  (:generator 2
    (inst bsf r r)
    (inst dec r)))

(defun bit-scan-forward (n)
  (bit-scan-forward n))

(bit-scan-forward 3)
```

Let's have a closer look with the disassembler. First the original code:

Feels nothing short of magic.
